# Ubuntu

This is a checklist for Ubuntu Kinda-ish:
 - Do the Forensics questions
 - copy script.sh somewhere but do <ins>NOT</ins> run it.
 - TODO 1: Change Variables based off of the readme. Basically edit lines 8-16 based of the readme
 - Save the shell script 
 - Run the shell script(Yes I could have added that in the last line but if you pointed it out, even in your f-ing brain then, ðŸ–•)
 - Wait, and take a mini break
 - chpasswd might be showing up rn(if conf then ask @Sanjit1): Enter and note passwords(Venkatsai passwords are the easiest to remember)
 - TODO 2: Look for stupid media files, and bad ass software then destroy it.
 - TODO 3: Go to settings and enable default update stuff
 - TODO 5(yes we skipped ahead, so stfu): If there were any services in the readme try to update it.
 - TODO 4: Figure out how to secure ports if you feel like 
 - Try to do more shit randomly
