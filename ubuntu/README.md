# Ubuntu

This is a checklist for Ubuntu Kinda-ish:
 - Do the Forensics questions
 - copy script.sh somewhere but do <ins>NOT</ins> run it.
 - TODO 1: Change Variables based off of the readme. Basically edit lines 8-16 based of the readme
 - Save the shell script 
 - Run the shell script(Yes I could have added that in the last line but if you pointed it out, even in your f-ing brain then, ðŸ–•)
 - Wait, and take a mini break
 - chpasswd might be showing up rn(if conf then ask @Sanjit1): Enter and note passwords(Venkatsai passwords are the easiest to remember)
 - TODO 2: Look for stupid media files, and bad ass software then destroy it.
 - TODO 3: Go to settings and enable default update stuff
 - TODO 5(yes we skipped ahead, so stfu): If there were any services in the readme try to update it.
 - TODO 4: Figure out how to secure ports if you feel like 
 - Disable Firefox popup stuff and if IE is supposed to be a f-ing alt(in 2 thousand f-ing 19(or 20 or whatever the f the year is)) then download it.
 - Try to do more shit randomly after the script is done running(you might have to go and keep saying yes to some operations, but ya)

Do not do stuff from the forty bot guy, unless it says TODO and then something, cuz the rest is scripted
